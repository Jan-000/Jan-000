Hi, my name is Jan. Previously, I´ve been working as an architect, but now I am switching to IT.
I  have completed Ironhack Web-Dev bootcamp (March 2022), mainly focused on JavaScript and React.
Other than programming, water is my great passion - be it landscape, watersport or backbone of world trade.
